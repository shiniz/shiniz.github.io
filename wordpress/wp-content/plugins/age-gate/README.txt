A plugin to check the age of a visitor before view site or specified content

== Description ==
There are many uses for restricting content based on age, be it movie trailers, beer or other adult themes. This plugin allows you to set a restriction on what content can been seen or restricted based on the age of the user.

__Features__

* Ask users to verify their age on page load
* SEO Friendly - common bots and crawlers are omitted from age checks
* Choose to restrict an entire site, of selected content
* Allow certain content to not be age gated under "all content" mode
* Add an age check to site registration forms
* Three choices for input; dropdowns, input fields or a simple yes/no button
* Customise the order of the inputs based on your region (DD MM YYYY or MM DD YYYY)
* Allow a "remember me" check box if desired
* Ability to omit logged in users from being checked
* Add your own logo
* Update the text displayed on the entry form
* Select background colour/image, foreground colour and text colour
* Use built in styling out of the box, or your own custom style
* Ability to add legal note or information to the bottom of the form
* Redirect failed logins to a URL of your choice e.g. an alcohol awareness website.
* Ability to use an non caching version

== Installation ==
1. Upload the 'age-gate' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit 'Age Gate' admin section and adjust your configuration.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I restrict a particular page? =

You can. If you use selected content, a checkbox will appear in content pages

= Can I add my own logo/branding? =

Of course, it's your site

= I'm in X country, can I format the date style? =

Yes! DD MM YYYY and MM DD YYYY are supported along with a choice of how the dates are entered.

= I use caching, will that be affected? =

From version 1.4.0 those using caching can select the "Cache Bypass" option to allow age gating even with caching on. Be sure to empty your cache when making changes to the plugin settings.
